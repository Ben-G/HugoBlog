# What I did in the past & what I'm looking for next

The goal of this page is to go beyond a resume and hopefully provide useful context on my past experience and on what I'm looking for in a new role.

For my work history, check out [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/). For open source contributions, [GitHub](http://github.com/Ben-G/).

The sections are:

- **Highlights and numbers**
- **How I see myself**
- **What I care about in my work**
- **Personal values [WIP]**

This is a ton of text. Absolutely no need to read it all. Happy to discuss in person.

#### Highlights and numbers

**Time at PlanGrid (December 2015 - Current)** 

- Lead feature and platform engineering teams, across **Backend, Web & Mobile, up to a size of 25 team members**.
- **Hired 14 engineers**, most of them senior, many through network and outreach. Reshaped a lot of the recruiting process for my teams and for PlanGrid as a whole. As part of my hiring effort I built **one of the strongest iOS engineering teams in the SF Bay Area**, which is widely recognized in the iOS community.
- Built a strong personal brand ([open source](https://github.com/Ben-G), [talks](http://blog.benjamin-encz.de/speaking/), etc.) that drove a lot of my recruiting efforts.
- **Shaped PlanGrid's engineering culture** through a series of initiatives (open source contributions, tech talks, 20% time for working on platform improvements, redefinition of career ladder & compensation bands).
- Contributed to PlanGrid's long term **product strategy**.
- Drove **reorganization of engineering into feature teams & platform teams** that can deliver on product strategy.
- Helped significantly increase the amount of product initiatives my teams delivered.
- In my first year at PlanGrid as an engineer and tech lead I **redefined the app architecture and patterns** to enable us to scale the iOS engineering team. Part of this is documented in this [popular blog post](http://blog.benjamin-encz.de/post/real-world-flux-ios/). Also significantly improved build and test tooling as well as release cadence.

#### How I see myself

I see myself as a very technical engineering leader who works best at the intersection of product and engineering. In my leadership function I focus on hiring great talent, shaping a strong team culture and providing the autonomy required for a sense of ownership to unfold. I believe team members deliver their best work when I combine freedom, motivation & accountability in my leadership style.

I'm good at thinking in systems and like to use that skill to analyze how a product & engineering organizations can be improved. This analysis spans people, organization, product and technology. I see my primary job as identifying and anticipating issues that limit my team's potential (now and at future scale) and driving changes to resolve them.

I am an open book. I believe in transparency and [radical candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537034596&sr=8-1&keywords=radical+candor) and I work best with teams and peers that share that belief. I set a high bar for myself and for others and I love when I receive feedback on how I can improve. One of my strongest values is to always follow through on my commitments; I hate dropping balls and very rarely do so.

I love writing as a tool to shape my thoughts, share them with others and foster discussions - [my blog](http://blog.benjamin-encz.de/) is an evidence of that.

Lastly, I care a lot about the personal relationships I build with people. I'm still in touch with almost everyone I worked with closely in the past.

#### What I care about in my work

- **Building great products & teams**
  - I consider myself very technical, I have a fair amount of successful [open source projects](https://github.com/Ben-G) and [talks](http://blog.benjamin-encz.de/speaking/), and I love staying up to date on what is happening in software engineering (one of my favorite current reads is [Designing-Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=designing+data+intensive+applications&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=229105010548&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12703251881550352481&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032076&hvtargid=kwd-297835422134&ref=pd_sl_1k8d3v58rz_e_p38)). That said, I have the most fun when I work with teams that use software engineering to build great products (developer tools are very interesting products as well!). One of the most visual examples is a hack-week project I worked on with a small team that uses ARKit on iOS to build [an indoor location tracking system for tracking issues on construction sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzf-DSlQDRY&feature=youtu.be).
  - While I love building products as an individual contributor, I've learned how much more I can move by building great teams that build great products.
  - In my ideal role I split time between recruiting, mentoring and building a great team culture - and solving interesting product & engineering challenges as a team
  - In a slight twist on the famous quote by Peter Drucker, I believe that *"Culture eats process for breakfast"*. I err on the side of "as much process as necessary, not more". 
- **Strong alignment with my, team, manager and peer group**
  - I've learned that a shared set of values among me and my peers is essential for working together effectively. I've listed what I care about under *Personal Values*.
- **Autonomy and room for creativity while being held accountable for outcomes**
- **Having a measurable impact on the business**
