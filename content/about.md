Hey there! My name is Benjamin Encz and I currently live in San Francisco. I moved here from Germany in 2013.

Currently I spend most of my time writing software, with a strong focus on iOS development. I'm working for [PlanGrid](https://www.plangrid.com/) where we are building software that makes the construction industry more efficient.

In the past I've been focused on building enterprise software & teaching software development. I've also worked for a year as a project manager and spent a decent amount of time with 2D and 3D graphics programming.

In 2015 I started to give talks at meetups and conferences and I've recently blogged more frequently. I've also started to work on some open source projects, such as [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift).

Besides software I love think and talk about economics, philosophy and politics.

In my free time I enjoy hiking the beatiful Bay Area, travelling and watching soccer.

I love getting touch with new folks, so [let me know](https://twitter.com/benjaminencz) if there's anything you want to chat about.
