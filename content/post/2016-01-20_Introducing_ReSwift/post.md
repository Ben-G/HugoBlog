For the last two months I have been actively working on Swift Flow with the goal of bringing the ideas of the Flux and Redux libraries to Swift developers.

At about the same [@ARendtslev](https://twitter.com/ARendtslev) started ReduxKit, which had the goal of implementing Redux in Swift. Soon he was joined by [@karlbowden](https://twitter.com/karlbowden) who made significant contributions to the project (and provided amazing build and documentation infrastructure for ReduxKit and Swift Flow).

**Today we have joined forces under a new name - [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) [ri:swÉªft]**. To put it in Karl's words:

> Swift Flow has adopted the name ReSwift and moved to it's new home as a nod to it's Redux roots that remain at it's core. Going forward, our combined efforts will be focused on ReSwift and surrounding tooling.

The core of ReSwift is close to a 1.0 release, however the exiting stuff is in its infancy. We will be working on declarative routing, time traveling, state persistence & restoration and more.

My hope is that we can provide a viable alternative to *MVC by default* on iOS by developing a solid core library with great extensions and developer tools.

Either way, it will be a great learning experience for us and everyone involved!

If you're interested in the core ideas behind ReSwift, you can [watch my talk from the SLUG Meetup last December](https://realm.io/news/benji-encz-unidirectional-data-flow-swift/).
