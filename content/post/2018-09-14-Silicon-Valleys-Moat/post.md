A few weeks back one of my favorite publications, "The Economist", ran a cover story titled ["Peak Valley: Why startups are going elsewhere"](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/30/why-startups-are-leaving-silicon-valley). 

This fall marks my five year anniversary in the SF Bay Area and I always wanted to write about what, in my mind, makes this a special place for startups. What better time than now?

Core ideas:

- Density of job opportunities means companies need to be run extremely well, otherwise folks will depart (similar to SF restaurants which have to survive on high rent)
- High cost forces big profit margins
- "You are the average of your five best friends" has a huge impact on your trajectory here. Will be surrounded by other founders, strong engineers, etc.
  - Support network for starting a business
- Access to early adopters, both in B2B and B2C. Consumers have a lot of cash
- Benefits are much stronger for founders than for engineers (but still strong for engineers)
- Think companies will keep getting built here, but engineering will become more distributed
  - Downsides to having engineering here:
    - People leave a lot
    - The best folks have their own startup ambitions and leave b/c of that
    - Very expensive
