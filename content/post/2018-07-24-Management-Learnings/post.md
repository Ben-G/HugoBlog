I love to ask people about recent learnings during interviews. A candidate's answer is typically a good demonstration of their level of self-reflection and their drive to grow. This post is a result of posing this question to myself, with a focus on engineering management, and writing down my answers.

Here are the high-level learnings from the last year:

- Communication strategy deserves a lot of thought
  - How do you balance transparency with controlling the message? 
  - Which media do you use to communicate? How often do you repeat yourself?
  - How do you balance getting feedback on important communication while still making progress?
- It takes a lot of discipline and courage to make (good) decisions with limited information
  - No decision is better than a bad decision
- Iteration on organizations and processes is important; but you need to strike a balance with consistency
- You need to be good at maintaining a positive mindset, despite typically mostly being presented with problems
- You're almost eniterely in control of your "roadmap" and tasks. You have a lot of responsibility to use that time wisely.
- Measures of success can be very hard to come by
- Spend a lot of time building momentum, positive feedback loops, encouraging communication, etc. Keeping teams motivated is very important
- Menial administrative tasks tend to flow up the org chart; you'll end up doing anything that doesn't have a clear owner
- Defining ownership & processes becomes an important tool in freeing up some of your time
- It is helpful if you become very good at task management (I use ActiveInbox + OmniFocus) so that you're able to sleep at night
- Your job is now at least to 50% that of a salesman; you sell candidates, you sell your team on new ideas & processes, at times you might need to sell company initiatives you're not fully in line with (disagree and commit)
- You will end picking up a lot of menial work that is only visible at your level (e.g. improve recuriting process, headcount allocation, etc.)
- Most people join jobs because of the team and the boss. And they stay because of the team and the boss. Invest a lot in personal relationships (skip 1-1s are "expensive" but worth it).
- While you're in constant problem solving, firefighting mode, don't forget to be positive and celebrate successes
- There's way too little software to help with the challenges of scaling companies; that's probably why most large tech companies have internal tools teams
- You're likely underinvesting in onboarding (onboarding folks into culture can be hard)
- Transparency and openess + personal relationships are the best way to fight the rumor mill that starts grinding in growing orgs
- You should have **lots** of 1-1 conversations. Especially when taking on new teams or areas or when you have skip-reports. Opening up these communication channels & bulding trust is super important
- Strongly encourage folks to give direct feedback, rather than indirect, it creates a much better culture
