Back in April I gave a talk at [NSMeetup in San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup/events/220950179/) on Functional Reactive Programming on iOS.

<!--more-->

The talk discusses the idea & motivation behind FRP and dives into some practical examples using Reactive Cocoa 2.x. The examples are based on a small [demo app](https://github.com/Ben-G/PeopleCRM) that I built for that talk.

Once Reactive Cocoa 3.0 has a final release I will likely update this talk to Swift - especially generics are extremely useful when working with the FRP toolset.

You can find a recording of the talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6mXJwFQ1YY). The slides are embedded here and available through [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/benjamin_encz/functional-reactive-programming-on-ios).
