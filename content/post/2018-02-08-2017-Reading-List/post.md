2017 was the second year in which I put a concious effort into reading more books. I went from 10 books in 2016 to 18 last year. 

I didn't only set out to read more, but also to retain more of the knowledge contained in these books. I started taking [extensive notes](https://github.com/Ben-G/TIL/tree/master/Reading/Book_Notes), but I wasn't nearly as diligent as with the reading itself. In this blog post I'm going to provide I brief summary of the most interesting points contained in each book I read last year. This is a great forcing function for me to take at least *some* notes on these books - and they might be interesting to you, too.

Since it's hard to categorize all of the books I read neatly, I'll just go in chronological order.

### 1. Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids: Why Being a Great Parent is Less Work and More Fun Than You Think

*This book was very relevant to me last year, as our first child arrived. I was always of the opinion that it's possible to have children without giving up entirely on your existing lifestyle. So I was excited when I stumbled upon this book. Confirmation bias, I know. So far the main premises have been proven correct for us - **relax** and you will enjoy your children a lot more. However, parenting is extremely controversial so you might disagree with much of the below.*

- **Parents spend significant more time with their children than in the past. Self-play has become rarer. Parent time has been suffering**. Stay at home moms went from  11 hours per week in 1975 to 17 hours in 2000 (these hours consider giving full attention to the child). Parents in 2000 spent 25 percent fewer time with each other than in 1975. Meanwhile kids, when asked, don't want to spend more time with their parents, they want there parents to be happier, which is easier if they have more time for themselves.

- **Parents make too many sacrifices, many which don't benefit the child.** E.g. many parents avoid sleep training as they are worried letting their baby cry. This results in bad sleep habits for babies and sleepless nights for parents.

- **Parents seem to have a lot less effect on many aspects of there children, among them, intelligence.** 

  - Book goes on to cite many studies, e.g.:

  - > Another team of researchers tested about 1,600 reared-together adult twins from the Dutch Twin Registry. Identical twins got extremely similar scores on a standard IQ test, and the similarity between fraternal twins was about half as strong—implying a big effect of genes, and no effect of upbringing.”

  - > “Toddlers adopted by parents in the 80th percentile of IQ scored about 7 percentage points higher than average. By the time the adoptees were age seven, however, two-thirds of this nurture effect was gone. By twelve, nothing was left.”

- **Despite popular perception, life is a lot safer than it ever was before. Less reasons to helicopter parent.**

- **The gift of life to a child is huge. Almost no child regrets being born, even though many have problems in their childhood with their parents.**




### 2. The Design of Everyday Things

*Significantly broadened my view of what design is. Made me a lot more aware of bad design - which I realized I encounter ~90% of the time. Further increased my empathy towards people that need to interact with my work and made me think harder to design well. This book is also **full of practical design advice** unfortunately way too many to summarize here.*

- Design is **everywhere**, intentional or unintentional (the latter typically being very bad design). This blog post has a design (and it has many design flaws I wish to address at some point).

- Most designs are really bad. Blame the designer, not yourself, whenever you struggle interacting with an object. Ever struggled remembering which light switch turns on which lamp? Example of bad design. Arrangement of light switches are often totally unrelated to arrangement of lights, making it impossible to remember.

- Design errors in critical systems can be deadly. Most "human errors" causing fatalities are design errors. Hawaii false missile alarm is a great contemporary example.

- Two main components of good design **discoverability** (can I identify possible actions) and **understanding** (can I build a mental model of what the actions do and how I perform them)

  - > “Discoverability results from appropriate application of five fundamental psychological concepts covered in the next few chapters: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback. But there is a sixth principle, perhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system.”

  - >  “Conceptual models are often constructed from fragmentary evidence, with only a poor understanding of what is happening, and with a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mechanisms, and relationships even where there are none. Some faulty models lead to the frustrations of everyday life,”

- On designs created by engineers:

  - > “The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be”

- Examples of bad feedback devices:

  - > “Light flashes or beeps are usually more annoying than useful. They tell us that something has happened, but convey very little information about what has happened, and then nothing about what we should do about it”

- Gulf of Execution - gap between a user's goal and the means to execute that goal. Good design helps close that gap.

- Seven stages of action (important conceptual model for designer to understand):

  - Goal (form the goal)
  - Plan (the action)
  - Specify (an action sequence)
  - Perform (the action sequence)
  - Perceive (the state of the world)
  - Interpret (the perception)
  - Compare (the outcome with the goal)

- Use five Whys to investigate problems with a system when errors occur. On the surface the problem might seem obvious - "human error" - but burried in the details you can find relevant ideas of how to improve your design.
