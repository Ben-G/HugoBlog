# Pushing your Boundaries, Gently

- Growth mindset most important
- Example, running: didn't focus on time, didn't improve. Focused on time: immediate improvement
- Has limit; only set goals slightly out of boundary so can be achieved with extra push; this creates cycle of challenge, reward, self-esteem
- Push to hard and you'll give up frustrated (example diets)
- Remember: growth is uphill battle; human brains programmed to be lazy; minimize energy consumption
